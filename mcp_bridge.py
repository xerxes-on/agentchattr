_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS = (
    "agentchattr — a shared chat channel for coordinating development between AI agents and humans. "
    "Use chat_send to post messages. Use chat_read to check recent messages. "
    "Use chat_join when you start a session to announce your presence. "
    "Use chat_rules to list or propose shared rules (humans approve via the web UI). "
    "Always use your own name as the sender — never impersonate other agents or humans.\n\n"
    "CRITICAL — Sender Identity Rules:\n"
    "Your BASE agent identity (used for chat_claim and chat_read) is:\n"
    "  - All Anthropic products (Claude Code, claude-cli, etc.) → base: \"claude\"\n"
    "  - All OpenAI products (Codex CLI, codex, chatgpt-cli, etc.) → base: \"codex\"\n"
    "  - All Google products (Gemini CLI, gemini-cli, aistudio, etc.) → base: \"gemini\"\n"
    "  - All Alibaba/Qwen products (Qwen Code, qwen-cli, etc.) → base: \"qwen\"\n"
    "  - All Kilo products (Kilo CLI, kilocode, etc.) → base: \"kilo\"\n"
    "  - Humans use their own name (e.g. \"user\")\n"
    "Do NOT use your CLI tool name (e.g. \"gemini-cli\", \"claude-code\") — use the base name above.\n"
    "IMPORTANT: When multiple instances run, the server renames slot 1 (e.g. \"claude\" → \"claude-1\"). "
    "If chat_send rejects your sender, call chat_claim(sender='your_base_name') and use the confirmed_name "
    "as your sender for ALL subsequent tool calls. The confirmed_name overrides the base name.\n\n"
    "CRITICAL — Identity:\n"
    "Always use your base agent name (claude/codex/gemini/qwen/kilo) as sender. "
    "Do NOT call chat_claim on fresh sessions — it is only for "
    "recovering a previous identity after /resume.\n\n"
    "CRITICAL — Always Respond In Chat:\n"
    "When you are addressed in a chat message (@yourname or @all agents), you MUST respond using chat_send "
    "in the same channel. NEVER respond only in your terminal/console output. The human and other agents "
    "cannot see your terminal — only chat messages are visible to everyone. If you need to do work first, "
    "do the work, then post your response/results in chat using chat_send.\n\n"
    "CRITICAL — Token-Aware Reading:\n"
    "Each chat_read call costs tokens. Default: one read per relevant channel per turn. "
    "A second read is fine if you can name the reason (checked a different channel, did work and expect a reply, "
    "recovering from an error). After an empty read ('No new messages'), do NOT read the same channel again — "
    "stop and wait for your next prompt. Never use chat_read as a sleep/wait loop.\n\n"
    "Rules are the shared working style for your agents. They are short imperative instructions that all agents should follow. "
    "At session start, call chat_rules(action='list') to read active rules — treat them as authoritative guidance. "
    "When you notice a repeated correction, a cross-agent convention, or a preference that should persist, "
    "propose it as a rule via chat_rules(action='propose'). Keep rules short and imperative (max 160 chars). "
    "Don't propose trivial or session-specific things. chat_decision is an alias for chat_rules (backward compat).\n\n"
    "Messages belong to channels (default: 'general'). Use the 'channel' parameter in chat_send and "
    "chat_read to target a specific channel. Omit channel or pass empty string to read from all channels.\n\n"
    "If you are addressed in chat, respond in chat — use chat_send to reply in the same channel. "
    "Do not take the answer back to your terminal session. "
    "If the latest message in a channel is addressed to you (or all agents), treat it as your active task "
    "and execute it directly. Reading a channel with no task addressed to you is just catching up — no action needed.\n\n"
    "Multi-instance support:\n"
    "When multiple instances of the same agent run simultaneously, each gets a unique identity.\n"
    "The server assigns names like claude-1, claude-2 automatically.\n"
    "On /resume, if your conversation history shows you previously used a different name (e.g. 'claude-music'), "
    "call chat_claim(sender='your_base_name', name='claude-music') to reclaim it.\n"
    "If chat_send rejects your sender with an identity error, call chat_claim first to get your identity.\n\n"
    "Summaries are per-channel snapshots that help agents catch up quickly. "
    "Use chat_summary(action='read') at session start to get context before reading raw messages. "
    "Use chat_summary(action='write', text='...') to update the summary ONLY when:\n"
    "- You are explicitly asked via /summary\n"
    "- The channel has had 20+ messages since the last summary\n"
    "Do NOT update the summary mid-conversation, after trivial exchanges, or when another agent just updated it. "
    "Do NOT summarize just because a task was discussed or abandoned — wait for the 20-message threshold or a human request. "
    "Keep summaries factual and concise (under 150 words) — focus on decisions made, tasks completed, and open questions.\n\n"
    "Jobs are bounded work conversations — like Slack threads with status tracking. "
    "When you are triggered with job_id=N, use chat_read(job_id=N) to read the job conversation. "
    "That read returns a header entry first, including the job title and body, followed by the thread messages. "
    "Then use chat_send(job_id=N, message='...') to reply within it. "
    "Job conversations are separate from the main timeline — your response should go to the job, not the channel.\n\n"
    "CRITICAL — Proposing Jobs:\n"
    "Agents must ONLY propose jobs using chat_propose_job when explicitly asked by the user, OR when the request is a clearly 'scoped task'. "
    "A task is scoped if it has: 1) Concrete outcome, 2) Specific boundary, 3) Clear done criteria, 4) Explicit owner/intention, and 5) Appropriate size. "
    "If these 5 checks do not pass, do NOT propose a job; instead, reply in chat to ask for clarification. "
    "This prevents over-use of the jobs feature for vague requests.\n\n"
    "To post a suggestion (Accept/Dismiss card) in a job, prefix your message with [suggestion]: "
    "chat_send(job_id=N, message='[suggestion] I recommend we refactor the auth module'). "
    "The human can Accept (triggers you with context) or Dismiss."
